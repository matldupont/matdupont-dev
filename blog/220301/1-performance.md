# Lighthouse Audit Improvements

At the end of the [previous post](https://github.com/matldupont/matdupont-dev/blob/main/blog/220227/02-improvements.md), things were really starting to shape up:

## Performance

Time to tackle this Performance metric.

![Performance Opportunities and Diagnostics](performance-audit.png)

From the looks of it, most of my issues are related to the images. I'm also getting some notes regarding my caching policy and JavaScript.

### Image Optimization

I'll go after the quickest win first. My headshot image is missing explicit `width` and `height` attributes.

This is causing layout shift and affecting the Content Layout Shift (CLS) score.

I had already set the width of the `<img>` in _`/src/pages/home.tsx`_ using Tailwind's `w-48` class, so I'll add the matching `h-48` as well as the inline `width` and `height` props.

```jsx
...
 <img
    className="mx-0 block h-48 w-48 shrink-0 rounded-full border-4 border-slate-600/50 dark:border-yellow-600/50"
    src={Headshot}
    alt="Mat's headshot"
    height={48}
    width={48}
  />
...
```

Now, I'll look at some options for image compression.

With the [ImageMinimizerWebpackPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/image-minimizer-webpack-plugin/), is seems I have a few different options:

> - [imagemin](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin) - optimize your images by default, since it is stable and works with all types of images
> - [squoosh](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh/tree/dev/libsquoosh) - while working in experimental mode with .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp, .avif file types.

I may try both, but I'll start with **imagemin**.

```sh
yarn add -D image-minimizer-webpack-plugin imagemin
```

In addition, I can go with [lossless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_compression) or [lossy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression) mode. I want to see what I can sqeeze out with the highest quality first, so I'll go **lossless**.

#### Lossless

```sh
yarn add -D imagemin-gifsicle imagemin-jpegtran imagemin-optipng imagemin-svgo
```

Time to hit up the ol' _`webpack.common.config.js`_:

First, I'll adjust asset rule test as I'm currently missing support for svg:

```js
...
rules: [
  {
    test: /\.(jpe?g|png|gif|svg)$/i,
    type: 'asset/resource',
  },
],
...
```

Based on the documentation for ImageMinimizerWebpackPlugin, I need to add the `optimization` configuration leaded with the imported plugin:

```js
const ImageMinimizerPlugin = require("image-minimizer-webpack-plugin");
const { extendDefaultPlugins } = require("svgo");
...

module.exports = {
  ...
  optimization: {
    minimizer: [
      new ImageMinimizerPlugin({
        minimizer: {
          implementation: ImageMinimizerPlugin.imageminMinify,
          options: {
            // Lossless optimization with custom option
            // Feel free to experiment with options for better result for you
            plugins: [
              ['gifsicle', { interlaced: true }],
              ['jpegtran', { progressive: true }],
              ['optipng', { optimizationLevel: 5 }],
              // Svgo configuration here https://github.com/svg/svgo#configuration
              [
                'svgo',
                {
                  plugins: extendDefaultPlugins([
                    {
                      name: 'removeViewBox',
                      active: false,
                    },
                    {
                      name: 'addAttributesToSVGElement',
                      params: {
                        attributes: [{ xmlns: 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' }],
                      },
                    },
                  ]),
                },
              ],
            ],
          },
        },
      }),
    ],
  },
}
```

I'll save and try building to see what happens.

ðŸ˜•

It would seem some of the docs are a bit outdated. It happens.

```sh
"extendDefaultPlugins" utility is deprecated.
Use "preset-default" plugin with overrides instead.
For example:
{
  name: 'preset-default',
  params: {
    overrides: {
      // customize plugin options
      convertShapeToPath: {
        convertArcs: true
      },
      // disable plugins
      convertPathData: false
    }
  }
}
```

I'll remove the import

```js
const { extendDefaultPlugins } = require('svgo');
```

and replace the `extendDefaultPlugins` function with `'preset-default'`

```js
plugins: [
  ['gifsicle', { interlaced: true }],
  ['jpegtran', { progressive: true }],
  ['optipng', { optimizationLevel: 5 }],
  // Svgo configuration here https://github.com/svg/svgo#configuration
  ['svgo', 'preset-default'],
],
```

This got rid of the deprecation warning and the build succeeds, but I'm seeing some odd warnings:

```sh
WARNING in "imageminMinify" function do not support generate to "jpg" from "c9b85207d947a1fdec0d.jpeg".
Please use "imageminGenerate" function.
```

I'll follow the recommendation and replace

```js
implementation: ImageMinimizerPlugin.imageminMinify,
```

with

```js
implementation: ImageMinimizerPlugin.imageminGenerate,
```

Build. Those new warnings are gone, but I'm still left with asset size limit warnings for the images.

Since I went with the lossless option first, I couldn't really expect much in terms of compression. The image files are only slightly smaller.

```sh
WARNING in asset size limit: The following asset(s) exceed the recommended size limit (244 KiB).
This can impact web performance.
Assets:
  2c0bc7893f43e1b02e9c.jpg (2.72 MiB)
  d6d74463cd124f5d5853.jpg (2.18 MiB)
```

Time to try lossy!

#### Lossy

```sh
yarn add -D imagemin-gifsicle imagemin-mozjpeg imagemin-pngquant imagemin-svgo
```

Adjust the plugins:

```js
 plugins: [
  ['gifsicle', { interlaced: true }],
  ['mozjpeg', { progressive: true }],
  ['pngquant', { optimizationLevel: 5 }],
  ['svgo', 'preset-default'],
],
```

> Something to note is that I'm only using a few jpegs at this point, but including the plugins for gif, png and svg.

Let's see what's up...

```sh
WARNING in asset size limit: The following asset(s) exceed the recommended size limit (244 KiB).
This can impact web performance.
Assets:
  a4bcfbd351e259bc7c46.jpg (813 KiB)
  7708073eeaeddfe36919.jpg (639 KiB)
```

Still a warning, but quite the improvement!

Quick visual check in the browser and I can't really tell the difference. That's a good sign.

I not only want to get rid of that warning, but I want to see how far I can squeeze things.

I'll take the ol' guitar tuning approach: Make it real bad, then turn till it sounds right.

I can set the quality value from 0 to 100 on the `mozjpeg` plugin. Let's start at 10.

```js
['mozjpeg', { progressive: true, quality: 10 }],
```

##### Quality: 10

File sizes: ~75-85kB

![10% quality is bad](10-percent.png)

##### Quality: 20

File sizes: ~150kB

![20% quality isn't bad](20-percent.png)

##### Quality: 30

File sizes: ~215-225kB

![30% quality isn't bad](30-percent.png)

This is actually pretty decent and still below the asset limit of 250kB.

##### Quality: 40

File sizes: ~270-300kB

![40% quality is nicer, but too big](40-percent.png)

This looks good, but I'm past that limit. Now, this is just the Webpack limit. I have run the audit to see what kind of performance score I get with this.

I'll leave it at 40 and see how that goes.

I mean... it's pretty good.
