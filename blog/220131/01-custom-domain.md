# Customer Domains and SSL Certs

## Custom Domains

I'm rebuilding an existing site, so I already have the domain I want to use: [matdupont.dev](https://matdupont.dev)

\* Who knows what you'll see at that url by the time you read this.

I purchased mine from [rebel.com](https://rebel.com). I'm their former _R&D Technical Lead_ and had purchased it when the `.dev` TLD first dropped.

In either case, I'm not buying a new one from AWS Route53.

If I navigate to my [CloudFront distribution](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront), I see under _Settings_ that I have no _Alternate domain names_ listed.

Luckily, I can _Edit_ these settings and get going.

Under **Alternate domain name (CNAME) - _optional_**, I'll be adding a few items.

- matdupont.dev
- www.matdupont.dev
- \*.matdupont.dev

If I try to save now, I get a warning telling me I need to "attach a trusted certification..."

Scroll back up a bit and it looks like I can request said certificate right here! ðŸ‘Œ

## SSL Certificate

I've now entered the **Request certificate** flow on a new page. AWS isn't exactly the gold standard when it comes to UX, so I hope this ties back to the previous settings I have, mid-edit.

I'm left with only one enabled certificate type to choose from: _public_. Cool. ... Next!

Now, I need to enter my _Fully qualified domain name_. After clicking the info link, I see they're referring to the domain I own and highlight that I can use a leading \* wildcard to protect any subdomain on my site. I can also add more than one. Sweet.

```
matdupont.dev
*.matdupont.dev
```

I have access to the DNS records on my domain through my Rebel account, so I'll select _DNS validation - recommended_.

**Request!**

Apparently it's now _Pending validation_. It's not really telling me much else up front.

...

Okay, after a few minutes of digging, I found [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/dns-validation.html)

Luckily, I still have the _AWS Certificate Manager_ open, showing me the pending certificate.

I'll _Export to CSV_ under the _Domains_ section to get my records. I don't feel like sifting through a CSV file, even one this short, so I'll import this into a Google Sheet.

Now I can see my Domain names, Record Names, Record Types and Records Values. It's the same cert, so the data is identical for both domains listed.

I make my way over to the Domain Manager in my Rebel account, select my domain and _Manage Advanced DNS Records_. Here, I add two **CNAME** records matching the Domains in my `.csv` and the respective Record Values. Save.

I've read this can take a while.

....

Okay, so at some point in the last hour, the ACM certificate I requested appeared in the _Custom SSL certificates_ dropdown in the CloudFront distribution settings way back at the start of this ordeal. I'll select that one and finally save my changes.

It takes a while for DNS settings to take effect.
