# Audit improvements

## Accessibility

I only seem to have one glaring a11y issue, so I'll knock that one out right away.

```
<html> element does not have a [lang] attribute
```

The problem here is that I'm not telling the browser that my copy is in English. This leaves a screen reader to try going through my site in whatever language is set in a user's screen reader.

I'm not sure if or when I'll tackle an internationalization (i18n) for the site, but for now it's a matter of setting this in my _`/src/index.html`_

```html
<html lang="en" class="h-full bg-red-300 dark:bg-red-900"></html>
```

I can test this change by running another audit from my dev server. I'm not currently concerned with the Performance score, so I don't have to go through the trouble of redeploying with every change just yet.

Sweet.

I'll reiterate that this doesn't necessarily mean my site is completely accessible to all users. I just don't have any super obvious issues.

## Best Practices

Next up, what's the favicon crap?!

Welp, I don't have a logo nor the skills to design and create one in a pinch. Might as well use my headshot! It'll be tiny, but it'll be something. Besides, it'll be on only page anyway. People will be able to put 2 and 2 together, right? ðŸ¤ž

So, the massive _`headshot.jpg`_ is my source. I'll head over to [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) to generate my favicon.

As expected, I can't just convert this source file. I have to convert to an intermediate png first.

[cloudconvert](https://cloudconvert.com/jpg-to-png) has my back!

So, I first create a _`headshot.png`_ from my _`headshot.jpg`_ file. Might as well add that to my `/src/assets` folder for safe keeping.

Next, I create the _`favicon.ico`_ from _`headshot.png`_

This great! favicon.io didn't just create the one file, but all the variants I'll likely need. This should come in handy when I get to my PWA. ðŸ¤˜

![Favicon Download Directory](icon-directory.png)

I'm going to dump all the contents into a new `/src/assets/favicon/` directory.

Since I'm using Webpack to bundle all my code create the index.html for the site, this is where I can set the favicon. All I have to do is add to the `HtmlWebpackPlugin` configuration.

_`webpack.common.config.js`_:

```js
...
plugins: [
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
    template: 'src/index.html',
    favicon: 'src/assets/favicon/favicon.ico',
  }),
  ...
]
...
```

This time, I do want to redeploy and see how this change fares in the wild.

New tab, who dis?

Maybe I'll make it circular down the road. This is cool, though.

Time for another audit!

**Alright!**

## SEO

As explained in the [previous post](https://github.com/matldupont/matdupont-dev/blob/main/blog/220227/01-lighthouse.md), most of my SEO issues step from a lack of mobile-specific configuration.

I mean... it's not mobile friendly at all.

![Site on mobile looks horrible](mobile-before.png)

The audit is helpful enough in explaining what's missing.

![Missing meta viewport details](meta-viewport.png)

So, I'll head over _`/src/index.html`_ and add to the `<head>` tag.

```html
...
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <title>MatDupont.dev</title>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
</head>
...
```

This tells the browser to fit the content to the device's width with no change to the scale.

**GOOD GOD!** That's ugly!

![Mobile friendly but ugly site](mobile-after.png)

But... it's working.

The remaining mobile-specific issues had to do with the tiny font size based on the viewport width. Fixing the viewport actually fixed those issues as well.

![SEO description issue](seo-description.png)

I'll add another `<meta>` tag for this in the `<head>`:

```html
...
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <title>MatDupont.dev</title>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="MatDupont.dev homepage. Welcome to my Playground. I hope it's even a little helpful."
  />
</head>
...
```
