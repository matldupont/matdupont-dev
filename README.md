# Hi, I'm Mat ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a Senior Engineer at Auth0 (Okta). I've been doing a pile of different things since I started my professional career in 2006. Right now, Front End development is my jam.

Welcome to my playground, personal site, blog... thing. The Mataverse, if you will.

As I build out my site, I'll be trying out new ideas and mashing up a bunch of things that _shouldn't necessarily_ go together. As I do it, I'll write about it. I'm not sure where I'll post those writings, but I'm guessing they'll eventually make their way into a blog within this site.

... as soon as I build that part.
